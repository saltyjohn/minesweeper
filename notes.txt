TODO: create_board() after first square is selected
         otherwise, it's easy to lose the first game
TODO: add counter for flags which represents remaining mines
TODO: with each turn, scan the board for total number of unchecked squares,
          if number is equal to total_mines, then game won
TODO: add functionallity to the reveal_mines method to make things a
          little more challenging: two recursions if neighbor_count=0, or
          no reveal if number is... something

This file got fucked up when I tried using the wemake-python-styleguide.
Honestly, the package is shit and there's poor documentation.
